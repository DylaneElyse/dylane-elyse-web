          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my website! I'm Dylane Cunningham, I am a motivated
            student in Software Development at SAIT, with a keen interest in
            technology and innovation. Eager to contribute to diverse projects
            and collaborate with talented peers in developing cutting-edge
            solutions aligned with strategic initiatives. Possessing strong
            communication skills, leadership acumen, and a creative mindset, I
            am prepared to excel in a fast-paced environment while leveraging my
            technical expertise to drive impactful results. I am excited about
            the opportunity to network, learn, and make a lasting impact within
            all the new connections I make throughout my time at SAIT and
            beyond.
          </p>
          <h2>Career Goals</h2>
          <p>
            Right now, I am focusing on mastering my skills in the software
            development field. Currently I'm learning the language C#, and
            continuing to develop my knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Some other topics I am learning about are Databases, UX
            Design, Critical Thinking, and Software Analysis and Design. SAIT
            has a lot to offer and I am enjoying the many opportunities to learn
            and expand my skills and interests. I am excited to see where this
            journey takes me.

      <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In my everyday life, I enjoy doing many things in various areas. I love
        animals and have two cats named Jack and Dianne; however, I am
        passionate about all animals. Travel is also something I am passionate
        about. I have spent time in Europe and Australia and plan to visit many
        more countries and continents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter, I enjoy heading out to Lake Louise or Sunshine and
        ripping down the mountains on my snowboard. I have been volunteering
        with Alberta Snowboard and Canada Snowboard for the past couple of years
        and have enjoyed it very much. I am on a women's soccer team that plays
        all year long, outdoors and indoors, depending on the season. Soccer was
        something I played growing up, and I quit early on. Getting back into
        playing four years ago has brought me so much joy and is an excellent
        way to be active and social.
      </p>
      <p>
        Video games and computers are something I am very interested in;
        story-based open-world games are my favourites. Board games are another
        enjoyment of mine. My favourite pastime is playing Dungeons & Dragons
        with my friends. It's a great chance to socialize and explore the
        possibility of what it would be like to live in a fantasy world.
