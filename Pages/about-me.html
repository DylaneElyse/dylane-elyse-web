          <h2 class="intro">Who Am I</h2>
          <p>
            I am a dedicated, responsible and hardworking individual with skills
            in Customer Service, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and Microsoft
            Office. Currently, I am attending SAIT's

            program. Throughout this program, I will further my skills in
            different coding languages, project management, time management, and
            communication. I am a strong operations professional with a Diploma
            in Apparel Technologies focused in Costume Cutting and Construction
            from Olds College.
          </p>
          <h2 class="intro">Career Goals</h2>
          <p>
            Right now, I don't have any specific goals for my future. I am
            enjoying my time furthering my education at SAIT and everything the
            school has to offer. At the same time, I explore all the different
            options and possibilities for careers. I know many people go back to
            school with a specific goal, but I came back with the desire to find
            my enjoyment and niche where I can excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            My specific goal is to build a future where I have security and the
            stability to support myself in all my endeavours. Ideally, I would
            like a career where I could work remotely and travel. I want to find
            something I'm passionate about. I am still seeking my specific
            interest, but SAIT will help set me on the path to success.

      <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In my everyday life, I enjoy doing many things in various areas. I love
        animals and have two cats named Jack and Dianne; however, I am
        passionate about all animals. Travel is also something I am passionate
        about. I have spent time in Europe and Australia and plan to visit many
        more countries and continents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter, I enjoy heading out to Lake Louise or Sunshine and
        ripping down the mountains on my snowboard. I have been volunteering
        with Alberta Snowboard and Canada Snowboard for the past couple of years
        and have enjoyed it very much. I am on a women's soccer team that plays
        all year long, outdoors and indoors, depending on the season. Soccer was
        something I played growing up, and I quit early on. Getting back into
        playing four years ago has brought me so much joy and is an excellent
        way to be active and social.
      </p>
      <p>
        Video games and computers are something I am very interested in;
        story-based open-world games are my favourites. Board games are another
        enjoyment of mine. My favourite pastime is playing Dungeons & Dragons
        with my friends. It's a great chance to socialize and explore the
        possibility of what it would be like to live in a fantasy world.
